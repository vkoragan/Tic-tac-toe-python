# Tic-tac-toe-python
This project was initially made for the project Tic Tac Toe for the Track "Python for beginners" on Hyperskill.com
After finishing the original project I modified the code a bit further and now the program accepts any dimension tic tac toe board and lets players 
play in a sequence.
